# Adidas Financial Performance Analysis: 2019-2023

## Business Task
In my previous Excel project, [Excel Football Transfer Analysis](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/ExcelFootballAnalysis), I used a series of techniques to clean and prepare our database. I also created tables to analyse and answer the problems presented. In this project, I am tasked with preparing an Excel-based Profit and Loss (P&L) statement for Adidas for the years 2019 to 2023. The P&L statement will break down revenues and expenses to derive Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), providing a thorough financial analysis of the company. My primary goal is to:
- Assess the company's financial performance ove the last five years.
- Identify which business segments are contributing most to revenue.
- Calculate key profitability metrics like Gross Profit Margin and EBIT Margin.
- Compute the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Revenue, Gross Profit, and EBIT.

During this project, I'll be answering the following questions:
- How did the company's performance measure up during this period?
- Were they able to accelerate revenue growth at a healthy rate?
- Which business segment registered the fastest and slowest growth?
- Was Adidas successful in maintaining its profitability while increasing revenue?

## Data

Before we proceed to prepare a concise P&L statement, it is vital to understand the source data and familiarise yourself with it's structure. If you look at the first few rows, we've got the follwoing:
1. Company Ticker: This is the stock teicker symbol, a shorthand commonly used to refer companies in financial databases.
2. Full Company Name: With it's ticker, the company's full name is given that the data relates to.
3. Periodicity of Financial Statements: 'A' refers to the data consists of actual figures rather than estimates or projections.
4. Currency: this indicates that all finacial figures are reported as US dollars which is important for accurate analysis.
5. Measuring Unit: This indicates that the financial figures are reported in millions (MLN). This tells us how to use and interpret the financial figures.
